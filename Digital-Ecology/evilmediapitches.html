<center><h3>Objectifying Indeterminacy</h3></center>

<p>
“As a ‘strategy in organizational communication,’ ambiguity fosters ‘unified diversity’... maintains positions of privilege, promotes plausible deniability, and facilitates organizational change.” (33-34)
</p>
<p>
“We don’t agree, but it sounds like we do.” (33)
</p>
<p>
Integrated University Wide HR/Financial/PR Strategy for Liberty City University:
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer: It’s doubtful that indeterminacy would be this straightforwardly coordinated by leaders (or that's at least what our optimism tells us), however it does creep in insidiously when institutions start believing their own spin.

</p>
<p>
First note to leadership: send no emails, have no digital or written record of these meetings.
</p>
<p>
Pitch: These initiatives could help address both our PR goals, and let us keep with our fiscal goals, repay institutional loans, and increase the university’s available funds for expansion.
</p>
<p>
Leadership Level: A self-imposed freeze on all Trustee salaries and bonuses. No other university has done this, this seemingly puts us at the forefront of university corporatization accountability. Instead, the limits of international lines of credit linked to the university will be upped for the board if needed for university-related purposes. Meet very infrequently, because of our conflicting schedules.
</p>
<p>
<center><h5>Financial:</h5></center>
</p>
<p>
Freeze student tuition growth across the board in the US, but increase fees for processing across all departments. Furthermore, make all these initial fees non-refundable.
</p>
<p>
Begin to create portal campuses outside of the US on subsidized real estate.
</p>
<p>
Housing fees will continue to increase, due to various factors including “Liberty City’s expensive real estate” and “cost of living”.</p>
<p>Address affordability with donation funds for student scholarships.</p>
<p> Create mandatory health plan fees for access to services at the univeristy.</p>
<p>Give out more financial aid, but in smaller amounts to increase our aid reach.</p>

</p>
<center><h5>
PR/Marketing:
</h5></center>
<p>
Positioning as an International Nexus University and increase international student enrollment as such to both increase diversity numbers and income from the higher tuition.
</p>
<p>
Emphasize the role of creating a global cosmopolitan student and send more students to abroad sites for educational experiences.
These will be taught by adjuncts and local contract staff, provided housing will be outsourced and comparable to US costs. Large margins from the difference is real estate is possible here, but not much difference in cost for the student from other forms of university housing.
</p>
<p>
Position as an elite institution by emphasizing a growth in facilities, and attribute costs to the costs of living in Liberty City.
Make financial information harder to track down and never put differing tuitions. Also all fees will be elaborated upon in the enrollment process.
</p>
<center><h5>Human Resources: </h5></center>
<p>
Entry-level hiring initiative in all departments, more administrative positions and adjuncts, and make a tenure track much harder to go down. Do not refill tenure positions when professors retire or move on, this could just be because there were less professors eligible.
</p>
<p>
Make the minimum wage higher for all workers, and send out a press relase. You have to be seen doing good to look good.
</p>
<p>
Make institutional processes obscure to different departments to have plausible deniability for all levels of employment. This means that even if something does go wrong, it is not the fault of one person. On top of this, because an employee is inherently part of this system, failure on the part of the system would also reflect negatively on them, so it is both a source of blame and defensive praise in order to protect one's on position in the system.
</p>

<center><h5>Academic:</h5></center>
<p>
Give more funding to programs that consistently turn out higher earning alumni, and market those programs more heavily to increase student size thus warranting the increase in funding.
</p>
<p>
Give less information about certain programs to prospective students to entice students into vague academic program tracks they may not want to participate in, but will at the same time attend because of their acceptance into them at the university. This will allow us to outwardly show a diverse educational and academic methodology, but will also allow us to accept more applicants. No one will question the program because to do so would also bring into question the ability of students in the program. We would of course defend the applicants, who may happen to average lower standardized test scores, because these tests truely don't holistically evaluate a person. We get to get to take the high road, more students get in, and we increase tuition revenue. Win-win.
</p>
<p>
Create larger class sizes, this could also be construed as issues of space. On top of this, a vague space issue gives us credence to further expand out into Liberty City and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Charge extra for inter-session classes in winter and summer to all students to create a pay-for-credits system at high prices for 4-6 week instruction.
</p>
<p>
These are just some of the proposed administrational efforts to continue with on our path to educating the world, while maintaining our brand and appeasing or confusing those that may question our ethos.
</p>

<center><h3>Abstract Captures</h3></center>

<p>“Control begets control as abstraction begets abstraction.” (Fuller 80)</p>

<p>
Pseudocode
</p>
<p>
Start simply. Start now. Start-up. 
</p>
<p>
At Pseudocode we make building your business easier by letting you focus on the bigger picture. The process of finding a good technical team that understands your goals and aspirations is difficult, and the quality of freelance programmers can be mixed at best. For many small businesses, the process simply takes up too much time and resources to sort through. Let Pseudocode’s highly skilled team of Full Stack developers, IT consultants, and Software Engineers work with you to create perfectly tailored systems that fit your business’ needs. Our team will be with you every step of the way, taking care of the nitty-gritty, so you can focus on making your dream a reality. Our specialists can work both remotely or on-site and can be specifically chosen to fit into your company’s culture and dynamics. At Pseudocode we aren’t just helping to build your business, we’re part of your team.
</p>
<p>
The Pseudocode Business Model:
</p>
<p>
With each company client agreement form, systems informatics and all website traffic is closely monitored and archived. This data is shared with the client company in order for their executive team to make informed and streamlined decisions. The data is both stored at the client site, and backed up at Pseudocode HQ for data security to prevent loss and for analytical purposes. In the standard working agreement with Pseudocode; all IT, front and backend systems, software, and data are operated and managed by Pseudocode LLC. The ownership of all aforementioned systems is jointly shared between the client and Pseudocode, and the client does have more control over intellectual property rights due to the nature of commissioned work. 
</p>
<p>
However, operations of all programs, websites, databases, and applications are to be done by Pseudocode LLC. Clients can choose to change what control the company has over certain systems to an extent via in-person contract negotiations, but database management, archiving, and analysis must all be handled by Pseudocode LLC, and it is recommended that more control be granted to maintain technical consistency. This data from a company’s customers or audience is then aggregated and processed with data gathered from clients in other sectors and the consumer metadata is sold to third parties. The fees for the technical team that the client hires are negotiated based upon technical considerations, number of personnel, and scope/scale. 
</p>


<center><h3>Multiplying Interfaces</h3></center>
<p>
	HAH Management Solutions
</p>
<p>
Our termination specialists will make it downsizing easy, and budget cuts painless. With our management solutions, your company will be able to retain middle talent for minimum cost. First downsizing, induces fear. Fear enough to accept no raises or bonuses, and the negotiation process will no longer be handled directly via a supervisor, but instead an internal advisory board. This will need to be applied for via a paper application. After the advisory board accepts there is another layer of review with your department head, if they decline, you can appeal in the next financial quarter. The department head will then consult accounting and if you are approved a sufficient compensation will be reached. When that offer is extended, you have to get it signed off on by your immediate supervisor.
</p>


<center><h3>Justifiable Ignorance of the Exception</h3></center>

	<p>DataCrunch</p>
<p>
Our company analyzing company data and systems in order to provide data products and actionable points of execution between your operations and your team. These data sets will only be specific software apps relegated to doing one analytical operation. Anything that is not caught in these analytical tools is not to be.
</p>

<center><h3>The Occult Virtue of the Project Plan</h3></center>

	<p>Widget LLC.</p>
<p>
Projects should be doled out to those who are on the cusp of promotions, or to new hires to keep anxiety up and connection to the company intact. The worst thing we could do is to have bored workers. The project will be overseen by middle managers, who also will attach value to these projects as it affects their standing. If they succeed, amazing, praise will be showered, small bonuses will be issued. If they won't, be disappointed, and talk about the costs to the company of the endeavor. The anxiety will fuel even better results on another project. Successful project teams will be given more challenging projects, and more praise, while we reap the reward.
</p>
