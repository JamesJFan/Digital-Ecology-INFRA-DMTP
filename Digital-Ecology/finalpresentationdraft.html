	<h1>Final Presentation Draft

New York City is made up of 304.6 square miles of land. And that 304.6 square miles not only contains 8.4 million residents, but the buildings and infrastructure that enable them to live there. While the prevailing image of New York City is one of glistening skyscrapers, shining billboards, and idyllic townhouses that mediated picture often overshadows the concrete reality. New York City’s public infrastructure is in critical condition. From defunct factories, to destroyed roads many areas of the city are just trying to keep up with repairs. This is all happening in the midst of skyrocketing land prices across the 5 boroughs, while many lots still sit vacant. For my final presentation I will be representing, as a volunteer, the Institute for Public Architecture (IPA) and intend to present a proposal for a multi-prong effort to re-invigorate NYC infrastructure to City Council, the Community Boards/Borough Presidents, The Offices of the 3 publicly elected officials (Public Advocate, Comptroller, & Mayor), and lastly to land development companies (making the case for increased income from long-tail holistic land development). The presentation would reference the 2014 Center for an Urban Future NYC infrastructure report, and current trends and community/business action.

The discussion about New York City land and real estate is one not a new one, and the oft repeated issue related to it perennially has centered around increased pricing and costs. With even New York Times noting NYC’s current comptroller Scott M. Singer calling out the city to create affordable housing on the 1,131 vacant lots that are city-owned properties. While some of these properties are slated for development in the coming years, some have been this way for decades. This is what recent Mandatory Affordable Housing legislation, that was unveiled more than a year ago, and recently passed on March 17th, 2016 will somewhat address with a city-wide mandate for developers to have to include 25% of all housing development be priced as “affordable”. The terms in the legislation of course are not entirely comprehensive, but are a big step in creating a urban land renewal instead of segregation. However, it’s not just the housing that is the issue, it’s the community built around these mixed income units. The transit, the parks, the roads, and businesses are key in not just making sure people have a place to live, but that the city is actually livable. It’s one of the ways that I, on behalf of IPA, would propose a 3 prong infrastructural update including the city council projects to update and repair infrastructure, community initiatives to turn vacant lots or old properties into public spaces, and private industries acquisition of defunct land for business creation.

The examples of the the will of the city council to push through ground breaking change is there, as well as the “community garden” initiatives run in conjunction with community boards and the Parks Department. And even the old Brooklyn Naval Yard Industrial Park corporate development is attracting businesses into the old decommissioned port, and providing jobs in area. It won’t be an easy task, but the social and future costs to New York City’s communities if these problems aren’t addressed are too high to ignore.
