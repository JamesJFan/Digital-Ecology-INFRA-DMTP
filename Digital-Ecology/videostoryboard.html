<p>
I want to start the video showing scenes of urban decay, and abandoned structures, vacant lots, broken down parts of the city etc. It'll be a tour of New York's oft forgotten places, with Red Hook Grain Terminal, various places in Brooklyn and Queens/LIC.
</p>

<p>
Next we shift to the coverage of various vacant lots and the audio from the land use committee hearing begins.
</p>

<center><img src="photos/storyboard/cityhall.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></center>

<p>
From here we get to go inside city hall and see how the legislative process works with excerpts of explanations of votes and terms of land use.
</p>

<center><img src="photos/storyboard/wall.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></center>

<p>
while this audio continues (albiet it will begin to fade) we cut to the hustle of wall street, and the financial district to contrast the scenes of urban decay. It seems utterly vibrant, because it's allowed to exist.
</p>

<center><img src="photos/storyboard/grand.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></center>

<p>
We also juxtapose Grand Central's commuters and space to the scenes of various buildings that are probably just as old at Grand Central, but definitely more forgotten.
</p>

<center><img src="photos/storyboard/hall.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></center>

<p>
Then as we begin to shift back to the scenes of forgotten land, we start to see the quieter sides of these iconic New York buildings and landmarks. At this time the legislative audio is cut out by now.
</p>

<center><img src="photos/storyboard/tress2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></center>

<p>
We center in on another no tresspassing sign. A warning to those who would disturb the artificial peace imposed upon conquered and neglected land. And again look at the side of the city that, while technically controlled, is allowed to fall into its natural state of disorder.
</p>

<center><img src="photos/storyboard/sunset.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></center>

<p>
We pan up to a sunset over the Manhattan Skyline from Brooklyn, to see that the city is quiet, calm, but still breathing.
