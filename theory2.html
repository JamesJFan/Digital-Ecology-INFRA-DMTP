Non-existance, Revival, and Power in City Spaces

How does something stop existing? On the other hand, how does something start becoming part of the spaces we have access to? From defunct grain terminals from the turn of the century or gardens in vacant lots from the 70s New York's land has shifted uses and boundaries quickly. Yet, the essence of the disruption of the rhizome of the city is not just totally abandoned sites, but also how these sites become "developed" or reused for other purposes. These pictures show spaces either vacant, revitalized, or repurposed, that are in transition from non-existence.



</p>
<p>
New York is riddled with spaces in between it’s streets and buildings that either sit vacant, or in disrepair, waiting for development. Many lots have been vacant since the 1970s from New York City’s infamous bankruptcy period, as the comptroller himself has identified, and are just now beginning to be repurposed. This process that turns the forgotten into the newly forged (and vice versa) shows the lifecycle of NYC land, and how in revitalization its contexts of existence shifts.

<p>
Places like the Brooklyn Naval Yard may not seem similar to places like Chelsea Pier or Penn Station now, but it’s all a matter of timing. Brick may outlive its creators, but it too must one day crumble. Ports close, and reopen touting businesses not battleships. Yet for the story of New York land, unlike the story of its residents, it doesn’t matter who lives, who dies, or who tells its story. New York’s land has been constant, but its mediation and governance has not. From the teeming forestland and wild of pre-colonization to the farming, development, and eventual emergence of the metropolitan icon we have today how we think about our relationship to the land has always changed. Even today, places in Brooklyn are becoming even more expensive than apartments in Manhattan. Which points to the example of value, as a form of human attention. And attention and Red Hook Grain Terminal doesn’t care that it is crumbling, we do. But it’s agency in form and construction informs how we think about space.

<p>
The conversation about existence and access arouse mainly as I started to go to these overlooked places, and found them purposefully imposed as places not meant for people. This then in turn had me think about why that is, what values drive our relationship with real-estate and land, both the forgotten and the treasured. And does it even matter? I think it does, at least in part, because it informs not only how the city is shaped, but how we start to think about ourselves in relation to affective spaces. Our historical relationships with land, how we envision space should work in a human context, and the laws/practices in managing space all contribute to this. We may design the building, but in turn the building affects our dispositions and decisions. We are no lords of land, merely renters.
